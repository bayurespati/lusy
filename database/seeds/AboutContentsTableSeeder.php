                    'Ikebana is a Japanese art of flower arrangement started 555 years ago. The word "ikebana (生け花)” drives from “ikeru (生ける),” which means ‘to arrange, to put, alive’, and “hana (花) or bana”, refer to ‘flowers’. Therefore Ikebana represents fresh or live floral arrangement.

                    The oldest Ikebana school is Ikenobo which located in Kyoto at Rokkokudo temple.

                    It is considered as the birthplace of Ikebana and as of today it is still utilized as a learning center. The school is led by Sen’ei Ikenobo, the 45th generation headmaster, and will be passed down to the next designated heiress, the 46 th generation Senko Ikenobo.
